* When installing this (at least in Plone 3.2.2) the skin selection is
  broken and you cannot e.g. look at the front-page, because
  document_view cannot be found.  Simply adding emaillogin manually to
  the skin selection works.

* You cannot change your preferences, as we will now complain that the
  (unchanged) email address is already in use...
